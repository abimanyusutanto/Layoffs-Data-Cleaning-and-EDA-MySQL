This analysis examines employee layoffs using data from the layoffs dataset. The key points of the study include:

- **Data Overview:** An initial look at the entire dataset.
- **Company Analysis:** Identifying the top companies with the highest total layoffs.
- **Industry Analysis:** Determining which industry sectors have experienced the most layoffs.
- **Country Analysis:** Ranking countries by the number of employees laid off.
- **Temporal Trends:** Analyzing layoffs by year and month, including cumulative trends over time.
- **Yearly Rankings:** Showing the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs for each year (2020â€“2023).

These insights provide a clear view of the layoff patterns across companies, industries, and regions over time.
